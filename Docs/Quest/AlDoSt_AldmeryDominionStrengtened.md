Journal: I met Cilderene at the Thalmor Headquarters in solitude. I asked to join the forces of the Aldmeri Dominion. To join she requested me to take care of Heimskr, a priest of Talos located in Whiterun. The Dominion is having trouble to put their hands on him, since Whiterun is neutral territory in the civil war. I must force him into submission to the Dominion, and bring him as captive into the Northwatch Keep. After I take cara of him, I have to replace the Sherine of Talos by a Shrine of Akatosh.

Objective **10**: Take care of Heimskr
