Delphine suspects that the Thalmor might be bringing dragons back for some sinister purpose.

The guards in the embasy will be notified about me, so I should not fear to be mistaken for a transpasser. She told me they have discovered the hostage of another Blade, Esbarn, but thinks he are going to be more usefful finding a sollution for the Dragon problem, than paying for his crimes. I'll find some diary logs in a chest to serve as a proof of my work for Delphine, with the location of Esbern._
