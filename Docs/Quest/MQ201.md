The guards in the embasy will be notified about me, so I should not fear to be mistaken for a transpasser. She told me they have discovered the hostage of another Blade, Esbarn, but she thiks this time he are going to be more usefful finding a sollution for the Dragon problem, than paying for his crimes. I'll find some diary logs in a chest at the embassy with the location of Esbern, to serve as a proof of my work for Delphine, so she will gain my thrust. She told me I'll find  a key there as well to be able to scape from the embassy secret passage too.
