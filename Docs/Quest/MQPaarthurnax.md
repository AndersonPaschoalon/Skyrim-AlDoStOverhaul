Journal: 
Cilderene congrated me for all that I discovered about the Dragons and Alduin. She promoted me to a Thalmor Justiciar, and asked me to keep in my quest to save the world in the name of the Dominion. I may request reinforcements, and have a new badroom in the Embassy. Since the Blades do not want to help with the task anymore, it is time to bring to the Thalmor hammer of justice. They must be executed.
